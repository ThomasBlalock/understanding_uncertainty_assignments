    "- Read the Study Overview and explain what the goal of the trial is \n",
    "- Read the Study Plan and explain how it was designed and why -- there's lots of medical jargon, but the main point is how patients were assigned to interventions. \n",
    "- Read the Results Posted: Go to **Outcome Measures**. Explain how table 1 (\"Incidence of Death from Any Cause or Myocardial Infarction\") is a contingency table. These are the data for this exercise.\n",
