    "Roulette is a betting game. There are 37 possible outcomes: A green 0, and the numbers 1 to 36 in red and black. Here is a picture of the (American, not Euro, it has an extra green 00) betting board:\n",

    "- Basic bets:\n",
    "    - Red or Black slots\n",
    "    - Odd or Even slots\n",
    "    - A single slots, like 20\n",
    "- More complex bets:\n",
    "    - Split: Two adjacent slots (e.g. {1,2})\n",
    "    - Square: Four adjacent slots (e.g. {1,2,4,5})\n",
    "    - Street: Three slots in a row (e.g. {1,2,3})\n",
    "    - Line: Six slots (e.g. {1,2,3,4,5,6})\n",
    "In general, you can only bet on 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 slots, 12 slots, or 18 slots. If your bet occurs when the wheel is spun, you gain 36/K-1 where $K$ is the number of slots you bet on; if not, you lose a dollar and get -1.\n",

    "- Write code to model spinning the roulette wheel, including the colors and numbers (you could make two lists of number and color and draw a random number between 0 and 37... or use a dataframe with color and number variables and sample it... or use a dict with key to number/color pairs...)\n",

    "- You wrote code to generate a spin of the roulette wheel. Now write a function that takes a basic or complex bet as an argument, and returns the result for the player (win or lose, and the payout 36/K-1 or -1)\n",
    "- Simulate betting on red, betting on odd, betting on 7, a split, and a line 1000 times each.\n",
    "- Compute the average values for the bets you just simulated. What are the expected average payoffs?"
